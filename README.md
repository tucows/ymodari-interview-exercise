You are an engineering member of Mission Control and your astronauts need to replace a critical piece of equipment at the edge of the galaxy!

The plan is to send this piece of equipment in a spacecraft using a series of wormholes. It is your job to calculate the total amount of fuel required for the spacecraft to reach the astronauts through all wormholes.

You are given a list of astronomical units between each wormhole as your input ([input.txt](./input.txt)).

The fuel required is based on the distance between wormholes. Specifically, to find the total fuel required to reach the astronauts, take each astronomical unit, divide by three, round down, and subtract 2.

## Part 1

**What is the sum of the fuel requirements** for all astronomical units between wormholes?
